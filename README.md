This project implements an advanced geometry class in Python to analyze the spatial relationships between various 3D shapes, such as spheres, cubes, and cylinders. By defining methods to determine if one shape fits inside another, the program aids in visualizing and understanding geometric constraints in three-dimensional space. Through practical applications, it showcases the mathematical principles of geometry in a computational format.
